# ParkSense
ParkSense is a smart parking system that uses CCTV footage and image processing to identify empty parking spots in large lots. It eliminates the need for costly sensors and reduces time wasted in searching for parking. The project has been successfully demonstrated in a real parking area, proving its practical effectiveness.
